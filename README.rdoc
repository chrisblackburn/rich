= Rich Lite

This is a lightweight version of the upstream version of Rich. It has many of the plugins and language files removed.

This may prove useful to you if you're deploying your static assets out to a service such as S3. In such a use case, you may find that a significant proportion of your deployment time is spent copying a bunch of CKEdit assets that you don't make use of.
